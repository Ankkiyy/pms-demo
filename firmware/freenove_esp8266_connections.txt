Freenove ESP8266 (ESP-12F) Hardware Connections
=============================================

Power and Ground
----------------
- MAX3010x sensor VIN/VCC  → 3V3 (3.3 V supply)
- MAX3010x sensor GND      → GND
- External LEDs/Buzzer GND → GND (shared reference)

I²C Heart-Rate / SpO₂ Sensor (MAX30102 / MAX30105 breakout)
----------------------------------------------------------
- SCL → D1 (GPIO5)
- SDA → D2 (GPIO4)
- INT → D5 (GPIO14)  [optional; only needed if you enable interrupt-driven reads]
- Connect VIN/VCC and GND as listed above.

Status LEDs (discrete 5 mm LEDs with series resistors)
-----------------------------------------------------
- Red LED anode  → D6 (GPIO12) through a 220 Ω resistor
- Red LED cathode → GND
- Green LED anode → D7 (GPIO13) through a 220 Ω resistor
- Green LED cathode → GND

Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT22)
----------------------------------------------
- VCC  → 3V3
- GND  → GND
- DATA → D4 (GPIO2)
- Place a 10 kΩ pull-up resistor between DATA and 3V3.

IMU (MPU9250 breakout)
--------------------------------
- VCC  → 3V3 (verify your board supports 3.3 V input; most GY-521 boards do)
- GND  → GND
- SCL  → D1 (GPIO5)
- SDA  → D2 (GPIO4)
- AD0  → GND (keeps I²C address at 0x68; tie to 3V3 if you need 0x69)
- INT  → D0 (GPIO16) [optional if you plan to use motion interrupts]

USB / Serial
-----------
- Use the on-board micro-USB for 5 V input and serial programming (no extra wiring required).

Notes
-----
- Keep all peripherals on the 3.3 V rail; the ESP8266 pins are *not* 5 V tolerant.
- Route I²C wires as short as practical; add 4.7 kΩ pull-up resistors to 3.3 V if your breakout does not include them.
- Share ground between every module so the vitals sensor, LEDs, buzzer, and ESP8266 have a common reference.
- If Wi-Fi noise affects the MAX3010x readings, twist SDA/SCL with a ground wire or add small (100 Ω) series resistors.
